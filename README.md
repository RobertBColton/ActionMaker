# ActionMaker
This is an action library editor to create custom drag and drop libraries for GameMaker or modify the default ones. It is designed with a similar interface to the original, by Mark Overmars, with some additional improvements to make it more user friendly.

The latest build is hosted on the gh-pages branch at:
https://robertbcolton.github.io/ActionMaker/

The project is built as an HTML5 application using [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs) and native form elements for the front-end. Visual Studio Code's [monaco-editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) is used for a code editor with syntax highlighting.
